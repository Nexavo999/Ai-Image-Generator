# AI Image Generator

This project is an AI Image Generator that allows users to create images by entering prompts. The tool integrates with APIs to generate AI images based on selected models.

---

## Features
- Clean and responsive UI for generating AI images.
- Supports multiple AI models like FluxPro, SDXL, DALL-E, and FluxImage.
- Dynamically updates the API request URL based on the selected model.
- Progress bar and notification system for better user experience.
- Displays the generated image with a download option.
- Proper error handling for smooth operation.

---

## How It Works
1. User enters a prompt in the input field.
2. Selects an AI model from the dropdown menu.
3. Clicks on the "Generate" button to send a request to the API.
4. The app polls the API task URL until the image generation is complete.
5. Once done, the generated image is displayed along with a download button.

## API Details
This application uses the **PaxSenix AI Image Generation API** for generating images.

### API Credit
The APIs are provided by **PaxSenix**. Special thanks to **@PaxSenix** for creating robust image-generation APIs.

### Request Structure
- Endpoint:  
  ```
  https://api.paxsenix.biz.id/ai-image/{model}?text={prompt}
  ```
  Replace `{model}` with the selected model name (e.g., `fluxPro`, `sdxlImage`) and `{prompt}` with the encoded user input.

### Example Responses
1. **Initial Request:**
   ```json
   {
       "creator": "@PaxSenix",
       "ok": true,
       "message": "Here is your job id and task url!",
       "jobId": "1735725689471",
       "task_url": "https://api.paxsenix.biz.id/task/1735725689471"
   }
   ```
2. **Task URL Response:**
   ```json
   {
       "creator": "@PaxSenix",
       "ok": true,
       "status": "done",
       "url": "https://litter.catbox.moe/3wzkzv.png"
   }
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the prompt text is URL-encoded (e.g., spaces become `%20`).
- The application polls the task URL every 2 seconds until the status changes to `"done"`.
